# Last-Mile-Optimisation

## Description
This project is designed to optimize last-mile delivery, improving efficiency by reducing time, cost, or distance in logistics. It applies algorithmic approaches to find optimal routes based on given constraints.

## ⚠️ Important Notice
This repository currently does not contain the source code because it is part of my IBDP Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA). As per IB regulations, the code cannot be publicly shared until the assessment is completed to maintain academic integrity.

Once grading is finalized, the full code and documentation will be uploaded.
